# ToonWaterUnreal

This is cheap cartoon themed water shader that I ported to Unreal Engine from Unity Shader created by Erik Roystan Ross(https://roystan.net/).

This shader uses two Perlin Noise sampling to create the foam effect combined with Depth texture to create translucent mask for rendering foam and translucency of water.
